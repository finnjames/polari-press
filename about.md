#### Mission Statement

Polari is a code-language crafted by gay British men (and to a lesser extent lesbians) in the 1960-90s to evade homophobic normies and undercover policemen. Pulling from dynamic influences such as Yiddish, Romani, and the drug subculture of the 60’s, the language is peppered with colorful colloquialisms like ‘eek’ (face), ‘fantabulosa’ (wonderful), and ‘alamo’ (hot for you). Though it has died out in use, the legacy of its objective persists: the desire to forge an independent language, a reality devoid of shame, persecution, and invisibility. 

We, the five queer uni students at Polari Press, have come together to revive this mission. The depth of LGBT identity has developed significantly since the latter half of the 20th century, expanding to admit complex shades of nuance in gender and sexuality. Representation of this diverse community has not kept up, particularly in the home of Polari: in July of 2019, we were shocked to find the complete lack of LGBT publishing houses based in the UK. 

At Polari Press, we want to represent all of London’s colors. To provide a printed form to these literary locals, voices which have been drowned out or lost in the wind. To give a platform for transwomen, gender-variant folk, and BAME queers to spin tales and wax poetic. We want to revel in our difference, our fragmentation, our novelty, to give name to things previously unnamed. In short, we want to create a new language: a reality devoid of shame, persecution, and invisibility. 

How bona to varda your dolly old eek!
