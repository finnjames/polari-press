### SUBMISSION CALL FOR LGBTQ+ WRITERS ðŸŒˆ 

Hey! Iâ€™m Harry, one of five queer uni students from a host of UK universities (UCL, SOAS) who have recently started POLARI PRESS, an LGBTQ+ focused publishing house. We started this publishing house after realizing that, shockingly, there are currently no established LGBTQ+ publishing houses in the UK. 
Weâ€™re here to amend this lack of representation, and are looking to publish new and emerging LGBTQ+ writers based in the UK.

Weâ€™re interested in your fiction, poetry, plays, essays. They can be on any topic, any themeâ€” we think its essential to represent all the complexities of LGBTQ+ identity, beyond just membership to the community. Weâ€™re particularly interested in experimental work, vulnerability & introspection; give us everything.  

Send a proposal of at least 10 A4 pages (or full manuscript, if available) to [polaripress@outlook.com](mailto:polaripress@outlook.com), with a short bio and summary of the text.

Weâ€™re pretty involved in the editing/compiling process, so make sure youâ€™re okay with that before submitting. 

P.S. If you donâ€™t exactly have 10 pages worth of compiled work, send us an email anyway, and weâ€™ll see what we can do :)
